FRC Team 449's fall 2016 preseason turret shooter project.

## Turret
The turret will be PID position controlled during autonomous control and
PID velocity controlled by the drivers with a joystick.

The turret will be able to be controlled using feedback from an encoder
on the driving shaft as well and be able to be controlled using feedback
from a mounted IMU.

## Shooter
The shooter will be a hooded flywheel. The ball-injection into the
flywheel will be done by a small, non-controlled motor. The exit
velocity will be entirely controlled by velocity control on the
flywheel.
